# Carbonix: Blockchain-Based Carbon Credit Marketplace for Indonesia

## Overview

Carbonix is a decentralized carbon credit marketplace built on the Lisk blockchain that revolutionizes how carbon credits are verified, traded, and retired in Indonesia. By leveraging blockchain technology, IDRX stablecoin integration, and Xellar Kit wallet solutions, Carbonix creates an unprecedented level of transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in Indonesia's emerging carbon market.

The platform enables seamless transactions between carbon credit generators (such as forest conservation projects, renewable energy initiatives, and sustainable agriculture programs) and credit buyers (corporations, institutions, and individuals seeking to offset their carbon footprint).

## Key Features

1. **Tokenized Carbon Credits**: Carbon credits represented as unique digital assets on the Lisk blockchain
2. **Multi-Level Verification System**: Robust verification combining traditional bodies, community verification, and algorithmic validation
3. **IDRX-Powered Marketplace**: All transactions denominated in Indonesia's stablecoin
4. **Transparent Credit Lifecycle**: Immutable on-chain records from issuance through trading to retirement
5. **Simplified User Experience**: Intuitive interfaces with Xellar Kit wallet integration
6. **Impact Analytics Dashboard**: Interactive visualizations for tracking carbon offset impact
7. **Automated Regulatory Compliance**: Smart contracts ensuring adherence to Indonesia's regulations

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built on four core smart contract components:

- **Registry Contract**: Handles credit issuance and metadata
- **Marketplace Contract**: Facilitates trading with IDRX settlement
- **Verification Contract**: Manages the multi-tiered validation system
- **Retirement Contract**: Processes credit retirement and generates proof of offset

These contracts work with a React-based frontend, integrated with Xellar Kit for wallet management and IDRX for transactions, all deployed on the Lisk blockchain.
